  Great design is driven by crisp information architecture and intuitive user experience. It speaks to your organization's mission and resonates with the motivations of your online audiences. We approach design collaboratively, beginning with an iterative discovery process centered on adaptive, mobile-first content.

It’s no secret that the way people consume information is changing: rare these days is the user who comes into a nonprofit website through the homepage and moves linearly through a predefined path. In fact, our aggregated client data shows that organizations with high traffic volume are likely seeing fewer than 20% of their visitors arriving through the home page. 

Instead, users typically arrive deep in a site through search or a link shared on a social network – and increasingly, they arrive through their mobile devices.

When we talk about “responsive design,” we’re not simply talking about the need to create a mobile-friendly website that works across device types: we’re talking about future-proofing your content, to allow as best we can for the next revolution in how people consume content. 


### Information Architecture

Every piece of content has core elements, but different types of content may have different needs: a long-form, storytelling article has different structural needs than a blog post, in terms of how it will be presented to the end user – and in how it is categorized. One of the first steps is to define the structures necessary for different types of content to succeed.

Good IA determines the ways these different structures relate to each other to create a cohesive user experience. 

In addition to content structures and relationships, we work with our clients to create an overall framework for their content. A site map essentially organizes content into the buckets or sections that make the most sense to the most users, based on how they’ve been prioritized. 

As with every deliverable, we treat sitemaps iteratively: we’ll use the information we’ve gathered over the course of requirements gathering to create two or more options, present them to your team, and use the feedback provided to hone the best solution to its sharpest edge.

### Mobile-first Wireframes & Usability Testing

If the site map can be said to represent information architecture in two dimensions, our wireframing process adds visual and spatial hierarchy.

We start with lo-fidelity “content slices” to define the essential elements of each major page and content type without regards for layout. Next, we develop clickable wireframes using the Foundation prototyping framework or the InVision design prototyping tool. 

Through this process, we’re able to minimize iterations in development and design because our clients can interact with the wireframes and conceptualize the responsive nature of their site on mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes very early on in the process. 

Both the sitemap and the wireframes are testable against data-informed user personas.

From the start, our process helps our clients understand the interconnections between website sections and content. They can test the work on any web device, making our work more tangible, reducing risks associated with misunderstandings, and allowing us to iterate on features and design much more quickly.

### Responsive, User-centered Design

Visual aesthetic completes the success of a digital experience. Through clean design, pleasing typography, and bold imagery, we bring our clients’ content to life.

Our visual design process starts with broad strokes to determine an overall visual design style and voice. We experiment with different styles of typography, imagery, colors, textures, and visual feel, all in a lightweight, iterative, and collaborative way. 

Next, we develop high-definition mockups and prototypes. Depending on the needs and goals of the project, we may produce mockups using Photoshop, Sketch, or with HTML “in the browser.” While we choose our design tools based on the best fit for the situation, our goal remains consistent: Create an amazing experience for users no matter what device they’re using. 

Creating a component style guide is the last phase of the visual design process. Modern responsive web design is all about creating reusable components. During this phase, we think modularly, designing all the small interactions that perfect the experience.
