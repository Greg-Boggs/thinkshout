  Users experience nonprofits across channels, not departments. Every interaction is an opportunity to increase their engagement – or lose their support entirely. We help our clients break information out of silos and flow across their distributed third-party systems. We understand constituent management systems so well, we even developed our own.

Users expect more from nonprofit websites these days. They’ve been trained by big brands with huge budgets to expect mobile-friendly experiences and content relevant to their interests.

While nonprofit budgets can’t compete, we help our clients leverage the power of open source to create immersive experiences for their constituents. In our hands, Drupal becomes a hub of engagement, pulling data from our clients’ CRMs and email lists to create experiences for end users that rival what they find on sites that cost far more.

### Constituent relationship management (CRM)

Every nonprofit needs a way to track interactions with its constituents – and this information needs to be available to multiple staff members, wherever they happen to be. If a volunteer coordinator meets a donor at an event, and that donor expresses an interest in becoming a sustainer, the appropriate person in the development department needs to know. By tracking the history of engagement with constituents, nonprofits can better serve their needs.

This worked used to be done in spreadsheets and custom databases, but the Cloud has opened up the true power of Constituent Relationship Management.

ThinkShout’s understanding of nonprofit CRM requirements is unmatched. Not only do we maintain the cannonical Drupal integration with Salesforce, but we built our own native CRM framework directly in Drupal.

RedHen is designed to meet common nonprofit needs, but built for flexibility. It has classic CRM functionality for managing information about contacts, organizations, and their relationships between each other and your organization (like memberships). 

Although it's a fully-functional self-contained lightweight CRM, RedHen is also designed to be an ideal integration point to enterprise CRM solutions like Salesforce or Blackbaud. We have synced literally millions of records between our clients’ CRMs and their websites.

### Third Party System Integration

We know it’s not always possible to build every feature our clients need into a single Drupal-based platform. Business needs and the accumulated accretions of history and technical debt dictate that many projects require us to create a cohesive experience across multiple platforms. 

The promise of the internet is that it will break down the silos nonprofits find have been built around their data. We have built a reputation for technical excellence in integrating with third party systems. ThinkShout maintains the canonical Drupal modules for Salesforce, MailChimp, and IATs – and we have experience integrating with other CRM and donation processing software. Yes, even with [Insert Terrifyingly Proprietary Company Name Here].

By using Drupal as a hub for the information collected from these third party systems, we build seamless user experiences that allow our clients to build deeper engagement with their constitutents.

### Digital Experience Management

Beyond breaking down silos through integration, we help our clients create personalized experiences for their constituents.

Imagine a donor who has consistently given $250 a year for the past five years. Why then would a nonprofit present that very constituent with a donation form suggesting that she donate $10, $25, or even $100? By accessing constituent data stored in the CRM, we can customize the donation form to start at $250, giving the donor a clear path to increase their commitment.

We carry this kind of personalization across user interactions with our clients’ websites – and beyond. If a visitor to an environmental nonprofit subscribes to a newsletter from a page about climate change, for example, that information can be used to customize the follow-up information they receive, providing more resources on that very topic instead of generic information about the nonprofit itself.

By satisfying constituent needs first, then creating channels for them to engage more deeply, digital experience management and personalization help our clients nudge users onto paths beneficial to the cause.

### Engagement Scoring

It’s amazing that Drupal can calculate the best piece of related content to serve to a particular user based on 17 variables. That does not, however, necessarily help the person tasked with writing the year-end fundraising campaign. Building automated systems that serve content based on what we know about a user’s history and preferences is one thing. Making that information useful to the humans who are the beating heart of nonprofit work is a beast of a different color. 

ThinkShout uses engagement scoring to make complex interactions understandable and actionable to our clients. By assigning values to user interactions online, we create a shorthand for their level of engagement: instead of counting the number of times a website visitor has shared content on Twitter, for example, our clients can reference a “Social Sharer” value that aggregates those actions into a single value.

Any interaction that a user makes on a website can be tracked. We work with our clients to create engagement scoring systems that make sense to them – and teach them how to use that information outside of the website itself.
