    column1: |
      The Colorado Trust serves a wide range of stakeholders, from health care policy experts in Denver to grassroots community organizers in small mountain towns on the Western Slope. In designing the site, we had to find the right balance of open, inviting content layouts that would attract new audiences with the robust search interface needs of policy researchers.
