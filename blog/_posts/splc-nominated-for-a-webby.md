Have you heard the news? A ThinkShout-built site was nominated for a [Webby](http://webbyawards.com/)! And yes, it’s a Drupal site.

If you follow us on social media, you know this, and you also know that the nominated site is none other than [Splcenter.org](https://www.splcenter.org/), the homepage of the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization committed to teaching tolerancing, battling institutionalized prejudice, and giving voices to the most vulnerable people in our community. Our partnership with the SPLC has been a source of great pride for us, as it’s led to an amazing collaboration by both our teams. Chiefly, their new site, which has seen an overall traffic increase of 60% and 130% increase in mobile visits. 

The Southern Poverty Law Center demonstrated its commitment to web excellence during this redesign by investing in a platform that supports the vital work they do in the fight against injustice in our country, making it available and reliable to the people who need it most. This was an incredible undertaking, and I encourage you to check our [case study](https://thinkshout.com/work/splc/) on the journey to the relaunch of SPLC.

The Webby’s are perhaps the most prestigious awards of their kind, and simply being nominated is an incredible honor. Splcenter.org is technically up for two awards in the Websites - Law category. The first is a Webby, which is decided upon the Webby Academy. The second is the People’s Choice Webby. While we can’t affect the outcome of the first award, it’s the community that decides the winners of the second. 

We think the SPLC deserves this award, all bias aside. This site is the outcome of countless hours of work, and careful planning. We strove to build them a platform that would further their mission and protect them from the forces of hate that they combat every day, and we’ve accomplished these goals. We believe that work speaks for itself on the new site, and we hope you’ll agree. From the Hate Map, which creates a highly accessible, albeit terrifying view of the rise of hate groups in the U.S., to the sheer volume of civil rights news and resources made readily available and searchable from the homepage. So we’re asking you to contribute your vote and show the world that the SPLC deserves the People’s Voice award.
