  Feeding Texas is the leading online resource for food assistance in Texas, bringing together and supporting over 20 local food banks across the state. Despite its ambitious mandate and broad reach, the organization’s communications team is small. Their time and resources are limited. Consequently, they need the most lightweight, “no fuss no muss” website possible.

  Breaking new ground in nonprofit tech, we launched a [“no-CMS”](http://thinkshout.com/blog/2014/10/success-building-cmsless-production-sites-with-jekyll/) website for Feeding Texas built on top of Jekyll and Foundation.

      The new Feeding Texas website was designed to be a resource for individuals and families seeking food assistance. With this in mind, we created an easy-to-use, highly-visual site. Key to its usability, the site features a zip code lookup tool and mapping interface that allows site visitors to find their local food bank and look up statistics about hunger at a glance in their county.

      While we couldn’t be more proud of the website’s graphic design, the engineering that powers the new site is where the true innovation lies. Jettisoning the traditional “content management system,” the website is built on top of a static website generator. Leveraging Jekyll, GitHub and Travis CI, content managers at Feeding Texas simply create and edit content in a text editor on their desktop, and then save this content to a repository online, where the website then publishes it.

      While admittedly a little tricky to describe, the solution could not be simpler to manage. It was less expensive to build than a Drupal website, requires no security updates, and costs just pennies a day to host.
