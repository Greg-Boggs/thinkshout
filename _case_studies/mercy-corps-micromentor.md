  MicroMentor, a Mercy Corps project, was founded to connect aspiring entrepreneurs with mentors. It also provides them with a library of resources to help them grow their enterprises. MicroMentor needed to expand its membership and improve engagement through a fresh redesign. We worked to make their new site a place for dialogue that encourages member involvement, streamlines the signup process, and showcases their successes. The result was a clean, responsive site that serves as a discussion space for a global community of entrepreneurs.

      While MicroMentor didn’t need a rebrand, it did require a fresh look, intended to appeal to a broader audience. MicroMentor has a large library of articles and research that they wanted to make easily accessible to the entrepreneurs in search of resources that would help them grow their businesses. This community-centric website needed to be a place that would appeal to both entrepreneurs and mentors, and provide them with a forum for discussion.

      ThinkShout teamed up with a third-party engineering firm to develop a way to better accomplish MicroMentor’s purpose: to connect entrepreneurs with mentors and facilitate dialogue between them. We overhauled MicroMentor’s member sign-up system and created a brand new, gorgeous platform for networking that was both visually pleasing and easy to use.

      MicroMentor’s new site launched in May 2014 to broad praise among site visitors. The site has been particularly well-received by mobile users visiting the site in developing countries with limited broadband access.
