We have organized our information architecture, content strategy, and visual design capabilities around the vision of "Experience Design.” This is driven by the need to design for multiple devices and by data showing that users very often switch between devices and contexts as they use sites.

When it comes to user experience, responsive design, and information architecture patterns, ThinkShout is a strong leader in the open source CMS community; 90% of our web development work over the last three years has been responsive, embracing a “mobile first” approach.

### Information Architecture

Every piece of content has core elements, but different types of content may have different needs: a long-form, storytelling article has different structural needs than a blog post, in terms of how it will be presented to the end user – and in how it is categorized. One of the first steps is to define the structures necessary for different types of content to succeed.

Good IA determines the ways these different structures relate to each other to create a cohesive user experience.

In addition to content structures and relationships, we work with our clients to create an overall framework for their content.

* Site Maps
* Content Modeling
* Taxonomies
* Page Tables

### Mobile-first Wireframes & Usability Testing

If the site map can be said to represent information architecture in two dimensions, our wireframing process adds visual and spatial hierarchy.

We work with clients to develop the framework of their site through content slices, wireframes, and more, matching the appropriate tools to the job at hand. Through this process, we’re able to minimize iterations in development and design because our clients can interact with the wireframes and conceptualize the responsive nature of their site on mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes very early on in the process.

From the start, our process helps our clients understand the interconnections between website sections and content. They can test the work on any web device, making our work more tangible, reducing risks associated with misunderstandings, and allowing us to iterate on features and design much more quickly.

### Responsive, User-Centered Design

Visual aesthetic completes the success of a digital experience. Through clean design, pleasing typography, and bold imagery, we bring our clients’ content to life.

Our visual design process employs broad strokes to determine an overall visual design style and voice. We experiment with different styles of typography, imagery, colors, textures, and visual feel, all in a lightweight, iterative, and collaborative way.

We develop high-definition mockups and prototypes. Depending on the needs and goals of the project, we may produce mockups using Photoshop, Sketch, or with HTML “in the browser.” While we choose our design tools based on the best fit for the situation, our goal remains consistent: Create an amazing experience for users no matter what device they’re using.
