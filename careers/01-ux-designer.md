We are looking for a User Experience Designer who thrives in crafting elegant solutions to meet the needs of end users while keeping our clients’ goals firmly in mind. If you love solving complex problems within a team environment, we want to hear from you. Experience in usability testing, content strategy, front-end development, and agile processes is also desired.

## Key Responsibilities
This job requires some specific skills, but we're also looking for someone who's passionate about the web in general and user experience in particular.

- Creating the user experience design for client websites, from kickoff to requirements gathering and research to the development of information architecture, wireframes, and final designs.
- Clearly articulating and presenting your recommendations to clients.
- Advocating for the end user, across the identified target audiences, both with our clients and internally at ThinkShout.
- Collaborating with the full project team at ThinkShout, including project managers, developers, and strategists, to maintain a cohesive process in delivering the best possible solution to our clients.
- Producing design collateral and other content for client sites.
- Staying up-to-date on the latest developments in user experience design and contributing to the development of our internal creative processes.
- Developing materials for internal use, including presentations, business proposals, and ThinkShout’s own website.

## Skills and Qualifications
- 3+ years experience in user experience and graphic design, ideally with an agency preferred – but if you have amazing design skills, we’d love to see your work.
- A portfolio that shows both great finished work and the process you took to get there (like site maps, wireframes, style tiles, etc).
- Strong understanding of web development – particularly HTML/CSS/Javascript – and responsive design for desktop, mobile, tablet – and whatever’s next.
- Understanding of web standards, analytics, and accessibility guidelines.
- Ability to produce a range of design styles, depending on client needs and brand guidelines.
- Proven ability to interact with clients, balancing their expectations with your expert recommendations.
- Ability to manage multiple projects in a fast-paced, deadline-oriented agency environment.
- Experience collaborating with others and working in small teams.
- Outstanding writing and presentation skills.
- Experience working with nonprofits is a definite plus, as is a passion for using technology to create social change.
- Ability to work onsite at our Portland, OR office.

## Compensation Package
- A competitive salary.
- Comprehensive benefits package including health insurance with dental, vision, and alternative care, a matching 401k, life insurance, short term disability insurance, and a very generous 30 days of PTO, including holidays.
- Get paid to learn and go to conferences like Design Week Portland, Convergence SE, XOXO, and the Nonprofit Technology Conference.
- A focus on work/life balance, including a flexible office hours policy.

## Next Steps
Send us a cover letter focusing on why you're interested in a career at ThinkShout and a resume in PDF format (or your LinkedIn profile). You should also provide as many of the following details as you can:

- Links to your portfolio, completed websites you played a lead role on, and any presentation or published articles related to UX or design.
- Any questions you might have for us here at ThinkShout.
- An answer to the question: Flat design, material design, or something else? (Note: There is no right answer. We’d just like some insight into how you approach design.)

### The Fine Print
This is a full-time position based in our office in downtown Portland, OR. The User Experience Designer will report to our Director of Strategy and work with our Senior User Experience Designer. This position may involve up to 10% travel, including attendance at conferences and onsite client meetings.
